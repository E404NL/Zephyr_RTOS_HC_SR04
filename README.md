This project is created to learn ZephyrRTOS.

In this step, it use a sensor for testing distance and a LED to blink when the test is positive.

Materials :
- Board : ESP32-WROOM-32D
- Sensor : HC-SR04
- LED (not RGB)
- Resistance 470 ohm

Software (in my case at this moment) : 
- Zephyr 3.6.0
- Zephyr SDK 0.16.5
- Python 3.10.22
- CMake 3.29.0
- DeviceTree Compiler 1.6.1
- West 1.2.0
